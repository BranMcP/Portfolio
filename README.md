# Portfolio
A Coding Portfolio for Branigan McPeters 

## Repository Contents
* <ins>**BinarySearchTree:**</ins> C++ coding project implementing a binary search tree with options for inserting into, searching, and traversing the tree.
* <ins>**DivideAndConquer:**</ins> Python coding project comparing implementations of a brute force algorithm and a divide and conquer algorithm using a convex hull.
* <ins>**FibonacciExercise:**</ins> Python coding project execising implementation of the Iterative Fibonacci Number algorithm then determining if a given number is a fibonacci number.
* <ins>**InheritanceExercise:**</ins> A short coding project to exercise sinlge and multiple inheritance in Python using shapes and shared calculations such as perimeter and area.
* <ins>**EchoSever:**</ins>: A Python project implementing an echo server/client to exercise socket programming.

## Future Expectations
I'm currently a student finishing up a Bachelor's of Science with a major in Computer Science. There are more projects I hope to add to this repo that still require refactoring, but I hope they will further showcase my coding ability once I have revisited their design and implementation.
Some of the topics I have learned about so far include:
* Operating Systems
* Algorithms
* Object Oriented Design
* Data Structures
* Software Engineering

In the future, I hope to add more projects that will demonstrate my understanding of these topics, and I will work towards honing my abilities to make myself a better programmer and software engineer.
